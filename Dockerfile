# TokTickIT — Unified production Dockerfile (multi-stage)
# ##############################################################################
# WHAT THIS FILE DOES
#   Builds ONE image that contains the API (Express) AND the built React SPA and
#   serves both on port 3000. Cloud Run (and CI) build/run exactly this image.
#   (client/Dockerfile and server/Dockerfile are separate, used only by
#    docker-compose for local development.)
#
# STRUCTURE (3 stages)
#   Stage 1  client-builder -> compiles the frontend (Vite)
#   Stage 2  server-builder -> compiles the backend (TypeScript + Prisma)
#   Stage 3  production     -> small runtime image; copies only build output
#
# ⭐ IMPORTANT
#   * The container MUST listen on $PORT (Cloud Run injects it; 3000 here) and
#     the same number is used by `--port 3000` in deploy/deploy.sh.
#   * Build from the repo root:  docker build .   (paths are relative to it).
#   * Secrets (DATABASE_URL, passwords) are NEVER baked into the image; they are
#     injected at runtime from Secret Manager (see deploy/deploy.sh).
#   * Stage 3 runs as the unprivileged `node` user (USER node) — keep it.
#   * prisma/ is copied into the runtime image on purpose: the Cloud Run
#     migration job runs `prisma migrate deploy` + seed from this same image.

# (client/src/auth/password-policy.ts re-exports it), so that one file must be
# present at the same relative path or `tsc` and `vite build` fail.

# Stage 2: Build Backend (Express + TypeScript + Prisma)
# ============================================================================
# CHANGE ME: replace with your backend build (compile / package your app).

# ============================================================================
# ⭐ IMPORTANT: this is the stage that actually runs on Cloud Run.

# --- Runtime configuration ----------------------------------------------------

# GET /api/version returns it, so the live URL tells you which commit runs.
# A rollback redeploys an older image, which carries its own older SHA.
